        I decided to become a software developer because I love creative problem
        solving, and am excited to further grow my skills in existing and new
        technologies. Most recently I have trained in full-stack software
        development at Northcoders. I had an amazing time pair- programming with
        my peers on small sprints and working on my solo and group projects,
        demonstrating my skills as an adaptable learner.

        Previously I worked as a search engine evaluator, where I contributed to
        improving the worldâ€™s leading search engine by providing feedback about
        the accuracy and quality of text and video search results.
